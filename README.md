# 🛳️ Titanic-Dataset-EDA 
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset.
The goal is to clean, process, and visualize the data in order to explore patterns and relationships between passenger characteristics and survival rates.

# 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is the classic Titanic dataset, which contains passenger information such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Passenger Class (Pclass)
- Embarked Port
- Fare
- Survival Status

# 📚 Libraries
The analysis was performed in Python using the following libraries:

Data Manipulation & Analysis: 
- Pandas 
- NumPy 

Data Visualization: 
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Missingno 

# 🔍 Key Analysis Steps
- Checked dataset structure and basic statistics
- Handled missing values (Age, Embarked, Cabin)
- Feature engineering (age groups, encoding categorical variables)
- Visualized relationships between survival rates and passenger features
- Built correlation heatmaps and categorical survival plots

# 💡 Insights
- Younger Passengers Tended To Have Higher Survival Rates, Especially Those In The Middle-Age Group
- Female Passengers Tended To Have Higher Survival Rates.
- Most Passengers Were In The Middle-Age Group
- There Were More Female Passengers Than Male Passengers
